There are some examples to work with Redis using PHP Client - <a href="https://github.com/nrk/predis">Predis</a>.

At index.php I show some basic commands to work with Redis using its defferent data types.

Also I've implemented simple examples how to register/login/logout using Redis.

Note, that you must run ```composer update``` to use Predis.
